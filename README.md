# Csharp-Console-Inventory-Manager and Description ðŸ’»

Description: This is a console-based inventory manager developed in C#. It allows users to add, update, delete, and display products. The application uses JSON serialization to ensure the persistence of inventory data between sessions.

## Technologies Used
* C# .NET: The principal language.

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): For modular code design and scalability.

* JSON Serialization (System.Text.Json): To save and manage inventory data in a persistent manner.

* Exception Handling: To safely manage invalid user input.

* Collections (List<T>): To store and manage the list of products.

## Project Characteristics
* Product Management: Allows creating, updating, and deleting products via a console interface.

* Robust Input Validation: The validation functions prevent errors and ensure the program doesn't crash due to invalid inputs.

* Data Persistence: The inventory is automatically saved to a JSON file when the program ends and loaded when the application starts.

* Console Interface: Features a simple and clear user menu for navigating options.

* Refactoring and Clean Code: The code has been refactored to implement the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, which makes it easier to maintain and scale.
